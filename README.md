## TrackNBook: Sri Lankan Train Reservation & Tracking System

**Welcome!**

This repository holds the code for TrackNBook, a comprehensive train reservation and tracking system designed for Sri Lanka. We, a group of second-year students from the University of Colombo School of Computing, built this project from scratch to address limitations in the current web-based system.

**What We Aim To Solve**

- **Inefficient Booking:** TrackNBook simplifies online booking and eliminates the need for physical warrants, streamlining the reservation process.
- **Limited Online Reservations:** Our system allows for a wider range of online reservations compared to the existing platform.
- **Outdated Information:** TrackNBook provides real-time updates on train locations, cancellations, and delays, keeping passengers informed.

**Key Features**

- **Simplified Booking:** Book tickets and generate e-tickets directly within the system.
- **Automated Warrants:** Forget physical warrants! TrackNBook handles warrant procedures electronically.
- **Live Train Updates:** Get real-time information on train location, cancellations, and delays.
- **Waiting List:** Don't miss out! Add yourself to the waiting list for sold-out trains.
- **Live Seat Map:** View real-time seat availability for informed decision-making. 

**Development Journey**

As a second-year project, TrackNBook was built entirely from scratch without the use of frameworks. While challenging, this approach allowed for a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies.

**Technologies Used**

- Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JQuery
- Back-End Development: PHP
- Diagram Design: Draw.io

**Contributing**

This repository is currently for showcase purposes only. Future development and contributions are welcome, but please reach out to the developers for further discussion.
